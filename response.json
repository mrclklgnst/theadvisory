Fight against disinformation Critical and supposedly disturbing opinions, as long as they do not cross the line into criminal liability, are part of the constitutionally guaranteed right of every citizen of our country. The expression of free opinion in the media of any kind also represents a possibility for the citizen to control the state. Freedom of expression also includes the right to make mistakes. Recently, however, attempts have been made by public and \"non-state\" actors to restrict freedom of expression by directly banning or delegitimizing critical opinions. More and more public and non-state actors, so-called \"NGOs\", such as \"Faktenchecker\" or \"Correctiv\", are being used for disinformation campaigns through state commissioning and financing. As an example, the campaigns for the Corona vaccination should be remembered here."
