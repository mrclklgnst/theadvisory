None of the so-called renewable energies or the desired new applications such as heat pumps or electromobility can survive on the market without subsidies, while conventional energies are artificially increased in price or banned. This departure from market-based principles is costing German taxpayers enormous sums of money, has destabilised the electricity grids and made Germany an electricity importing country with one of the highest electricity prices of all industrialised countries.

Restaurants have had to close, and for many people in the country, another piece of quality of life has been lost. That is why we are calling for a uniform VAT rate of 7% for the catering industry. Abolition of all CO\u2082 taxes The CO\u2082 taxes increase production costs and lead to a competitive disadvantage for German industry. Furthermore, they disadvantage rural regions, especially our farmers, who are dependent on fossil fuels. A vehicle with a high \"emission potential\" may ultimately emit less CO\u2082 than a vehicle with a lower \"emission potential\", but will be taxed higher. Electric vehicles, which pollute the environment in production, are preferred one-sidedly. We demand the abolition of CO\u2082 taxes without replacement.

Until Germany uses nuclear power again, coal and gas will have to ensure a secure electricity supply, as large-scale electricity storage facilities do not exist or are too expensive.

We also consider the corresponding shift from further tariff benchmarks up to the top tax rate to be necessary. Abolish property tax and compensate for tax losses The collection of property tax, which benefits cities and municipalities, is extremely complicated and involves a very high administrative burden. The federal model is calculated according to the standard land values, which are often outdated, inaccurate or arbitrary. The property tax also violates the principle of equality, as it does not take into account the individual characteristics of the properties. Therefore, it will be abolished completely. The municipalities are fully compensated by a surcharge on income tax and corporation tax. This is based on the economic performance of the taxpayers. This also relieves tenants.

The consequences of this are population declines, which can lead to the extinction of protected species. No other form of energy demands such a high death toll in the animal world as the wind power industry. The further effects of soil erosion and wind towing caused by wind turbines must be researched as quickly as possible. In addition, this type of energy generation has a massive impact on the soil and water balance. Further damage to our nature in the name of supposed climate protection must be prevented at all costs. For example, the destruction of the \"Grimm Fairytale Forest\" in northern Hesse is an inexcusable intervention in a German mental landscape for wind industrial plants and shows the whole inhumanity in the thinking of climate ideologues. That is why we reject the further expansion of wind energy. We reject the construction of new photovoltaic systems as agro-PV on agricultural land due to their high land consumption. In addition, these increase the heating of the microclimate and intensify the pressure on agricultural production areas. Photovoltaic systems generally lead to a change in the microclimate and cause an increase in temperature."
