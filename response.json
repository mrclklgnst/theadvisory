In this way, we are creating new financial leeway, which we will distribute appropriately between the federal and state governments. At the same time, we will ensure that the overall debt remains sustainable in the long term. This is also advised by leading economic institutes such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bundesbank and the German Federal Government's Council of Economic Experts. At the European level, we continue to advocate common fiscal rules that leave enough room for sustainable investment. After the grand coalition has ruined the country for almost two decades, we in the federal government have initiated the turnaround. Investments in climate and environmental protection, in transport, energy, education and research infrastructure, and in national security are priorities for us. We propose a reform of the debt brake and a Germany fund for investment expenditure. In order to finance current expenses, we want to close gaps in fairness in our tax system."
