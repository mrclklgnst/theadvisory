Today, the Conservatives want to reverse the progress made and save where many citizens are personally affected. Others rely on a policy that patronises citizens. The populists from the right and left, on the other hand, give completely wrong answers. Their business model is to divide our society. We say: All this harms Germany. That is not our way. As difficult as the last few years may have been, Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the SPD could always be relied on when it mattered. We have brought the exploding energy prices as a result of the war against Ukraine under control \u2013 and quickly made Germany independent of Russian gas. Pensions have risen sharply \u2013 and more than 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, they have finally been equalised in East and West. We have More for you. Better for Germany."

Therefore, we are committed to opposing any form of compulsory vaccination or compulsory vaccination. There must be no more exclusion and discrimination against people who refuse to be vaccinated. We therefore want to abolish the de facto measles vaccination requirement for children and teaching staff. With the approval of experimental mRNA injections during the Corona crisis, various occupational groups were forced to be vaccinated. Those affected must now be supported in the best possible way and exempted from punishment. In future, responsibility for adequate care for vaccine victims is to be transferred to the employers' liability insurance associations in order to ensure significantly improved treatment and rehabilitation for professional reintegration. The burden of proof must be eased for the proof of vaccine damage. Healer The existing profession of non-medical practitioner in Germany is facing efforts to abolish this profession. Certainly, the German Alternative Practitioners Act must be improved, especially with regard to the uniformity of quality and testing standards. However, this is not associated with an obligation to reimburse costs on the part of the statutory health insurance (statutory health insurance)."

          "content": "AFD: Supranational Organizations and German Sovereignty Supranational organizations such as the UN and the WHO are increasingly striving to disempower sovereign states and limit nation-state competences on the way to a \"world government\". The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2018, is a well-known example, the devastating effects of which for Germany through further promotion of migration are obvious. In 2024, further such contracts were prepared under the names \"Compact of the Future\" and \"Global Digital Compact\" of 23 September 2024, in the drafting of which the German government also played a major role. Ostensibly, these supranational agreements are not legally binding, but in fact they are treated as applicable law and grant the UN General Secretariat the right to issue instructions without democratic control by parliaments. The WHO's planned \"pandemic treaty\" continues the series of agreements on the assignment of instruction rights to supranational institutions. The AfD resolutely rejects this path of encroachment on national sovereignty and demands that these treaties be rejected or terminated."

All decision-makers of interest-driven measures brought about against the advice of scientists must be held accountable. Accordingly, those wrongly convicted must be fully rehabilitated and compensated. The laws and guidelines amended in connection with the coronavirus crisis must be reviewed and, if necessary, deleted. As a first important step in coming to terms with the coronavirus measures, we want to set up a committee of inquiry in the German Bundestag. WHO \u2013 Reform or Exit The financing of the WHO must be fundamentally reformed in order to eliminate the blatant dependence on private donors and to exclude their direct influence. In the future, the WHO's budget will be financed mainly by member contributions from the countries, which will require a significant adjustment of the structural and staffing of this organization. With the pandemic treaty planned for 2025, the WHO is already granted extensive rights vis-\u00e0-vis national states in the event of an allegedly \"imminent pandemic\" in disregard of national parliaments, which encroach widely on the privacy of citizens, up to and including tolerating medical interventions and curtailing the right to privacy. We reject this as a matter of principle."

We therefore demand that Germany reject the International Health Regulations in their current form before the deadline of 31 March 2025. Organ donation The willingness to donate organs has decreased significantly. For this reason, an \"objection regulation\" is increasingly being brought into play, in which organs can be removed in the event of \"brain death\" in principle and without consultation with the relatives, unless an explicit objection by the person concerned has been notarized during his or her lifetime. However, the decision to donate organs can only lie with the person concerned, who must make it in full knowledge of the processes involved. This also includes an explanation of the criterion of \"brain death\", which is not without controversy. In this respect, we firmly reject the opt-out regulation and any form of direct or indirect coercion. Gender identity Pharmacological and surgical interventions on minors to delay sexual development and to change sex are often externally controlled and ideologically motivated and can cause lifelong psychological and physical damage. That is why we will ban puberty blockers and non-medically indicated procedures to change sex."

Senior citizens The values of freedom-based politics apply across generations. For us, politics for senior citizens is a cross-sectional task, but one that does not understand the special needs as stigmatising age-related issues. We are committed to a modern image of old age that promotes the potential of older people in the workplace beyond retirement, in participation in social life and in voluntary work. We individualize the retirement age. With an improvement in access rights, we recognize the role of many grandparents in supporting their grandchildren."

Dear citizens, only if we transform our strengths into future strength will we be able to maintain and strengthen what is dear and dear to us. We emphasise this because we have also seen in recent years how tempting it is in politics to simply cover up the losses of the omitted change, according to the motto \"Nobody has to change here\", or to only dwell on the past. With Robert Habeck, a person is running for leadership of the next government who makes this difference. One that combines a policy of listening with orientation, learning government experience with the willingness to work itself, honesty with the willingness to tackle, strengthening the future with the strength of broad social connection."

Delayed trains, a shortage of skilled workers in daycare centers and paperwork with the authorities are wearing on the nerves.
