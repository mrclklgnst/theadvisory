GREATLY SIMPLIFY TAX LAW With over 30,000 regulations, German tax law is one of the most complicated in the world. Numerous individual case decisions by the tax courts are therefore necessary, but these in turn further complicate tax law. The collection of taxes is time-consuming and associated with considerable costs for those involved. This deters companies from setting up in Germany; many companies based here are relocating abroad. The AfD will simplify tax law by changing the income tax rate with a few levels. We will reduce tax rates, as well as the depreciation options for \"tax-saving models\". We will make corporate tax neutral in terms of legal form. These measures will make taxes clearer, and the collection of taxes will be easier, time-saving and cost-effective."
