The states and municipalities need more leeway for independent action as well as for concrete cooperation. Conversely, the federal government should provide a digital service for services regulated by law nationwide, which states and municipalities can use to provide services locally. Such central service units allow the Confederation to perform routine tasks centrally so that the local administration can concentrate on providing advice.

Professors and university staff must have the opportunity to express themselves critically within the framework of freedom of expression, without fear of disciplinary proceedings or job loss. Academic freedom must be restored. Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht - Reason and Justice Glinkastr."

          "content": "BSW: Working conditions in all educational institutions urgently need to be improved. To this end, teachers must be relieved of non-specialist tasks by support teams (social work, school psychologists, IT management). Teacher training should include more practical elements. Dual forms of training that lead to a bachelor's/master's degree followed by a traineeship are conceivable. In the short term, the shortage of teachers can be combated by attractive working conditions for lateral entrants. In recent years, teachers have been increasingly burdened with additional tasks, such as IT management, school organization, and psychological counseling. The formation of support teams for everyday work at schools \u2013 social work, IT management, psychological support \u2013 can bring about a decisive improvement. The children and young people themselves must be able to perceive daycare centres and schools as safe havens again \u2013 without discrimination, bullying or racism \u2013 with dignity and recognition. Education does not end in adulthood. Adult education centres must be financially strengthened. The chronic underfunding of universities must be ended."

Fundamental right of freedom of expression \u2013 no censorship in public debate Any censorship of expressions of opinion constitutes an attack on the fundamental right of freedom of expression. A supremacy in social media and education must not be used to unilaterally influence the political decision-making process. As quasi-oligopolies, the major providers of social media are to be obliged to respect the freedom of expression of their users. The Internet must be preserved as a place of freedom of expression. We will immediately abolish government censorship regulations and state-imposed agreements with private companies that carry out censorship measures. Self-proclaimed \"fact-checkers\" and opinion watchdogs must not receive state funding. We reject the Federal Government's increasing control and prohibition policy in the area of media and social networks. In particular, there must be no censorship by state-commissioned professional denunciators."
