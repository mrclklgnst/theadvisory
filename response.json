In order for personal initiative, entrepreneurial spirit and drive to develop fully, a modern infrastructure is needed in every village, throughout the country. With renewable energies and climate protection, it is possible to be in the black locally. The municipalities earn money from local energy generation from wind and sun and thus gain their own financial leeway. They decide for themselves whether the swimming pool is renovated or the community centre is expanded. Through conversion and renovation, empty village centres can be brought back to life.

The size and frequency of such turbines and their excessive attachment to wind farms destroy the landscape of entire regions, while even small residential buildings in the outer area still have no chance of obtaining a building permit.
