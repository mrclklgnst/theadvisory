At the European level, the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) will apply from 2026. We want humanitarian standards for refugees to exist throughout Europe and migration to be managed in solidarity. The individual human right to asylum and international refugee law are the basis for the Common European Asylum System. Border procedures must ensure high legal standards. Our goal is a truly solidarity-based distribution in which all member states participate. This requires more than a loosely agreed solidarity mechanism in the European Union. Border closures and blanket rejections at internal borders contradict the spirit of a common area of freedom, security and justice. The temporary reintroduction of internal border controls must therefore remain the absolute exception."

On the other hand, we will put an end to the aberration of mixing qualified immigration and humanitarian protection. The claim of a \"nationwide shortage of skilled workers\", which is often used as a justification for mass migration, must be critically questioned. There are enough potential workers. However, they often stay away from the labour market or their training occupation due to unattractive working conditions and false income incentives in tax law and citizen's allowance.

The current state of affairs is the opposite of the rule of law and is an expression of the continuing failure of the state in migration policy. Repatriation measures are circumvented with the help of old and new regulations on the right to stay, so illegal residence is thus made permanent. This is also served by the frequently used instrument of toleration of persons obliged to leave the country, a practice with which these people receive a residence permit that is constantly extended, sometimes in the form of a chain of toleration. In principle, a temporary suspension of deportation is only a certificate of temporary suspension of deportation. Under no circumstances, however, should the granting of a temporary suspension of deportation justify permanent residence. With the newly introduced so-called opportunity right of residence, tolerated persons who had lived in Germany for 5 years as of January 1, 2022 were even given the chance to obtain a residence permit within 18 months if the lowest requirements were met. In conclusion, it can be stated that the basic intention of the right of residence, the control and limitation of the influx of foreigners, has been reversed and downright perverted for years."
