Germany must no longer be the object of foreign interests. Together with our European partners, we want to shape and guarantee a future stable peace order. We must expand our sovereignty, confidently formulate our national interests and pursue them stringently. The AfD supports the security policy concept of Europe's strategic autonomy and its manifestation of its own centre of power in the changing world order. A stable peace order in Europe and the world also secures vital foreign trade relations and primary energy needs for Germany. We therefore pursue an interest-driven relationship with the great powers of the world, with China and the USA, as well as with the Russian Federation. Until an independent and effective European military alliance is established, membership in NATO and an active role for Germany in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) remain central elements of our security strategy."

There is a lack of personnel and operational equipment. In order for the main mission of national and collective defence to be taken into account again, our Bundeswehr must not only be well equipped financially, but it must also be given back operational readiness, especially in terms of material and personnel. That is why we want to reinstate conscription. According to the current legal situation, this also includes alternative service. In order to avoid conflicts of loyalty, service in the armed forces is to be reserved exclusively for German citizens. Privatizations and centralizations may only be used where they are demonstrably necessary to increase the operational capability of the troops.
