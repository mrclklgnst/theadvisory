The attractiveness of service in the Bundeswehr is to be massively increased through excellent conditions such as salary and social benefits. In order to meet the demand for defence capability, Germany must also make its actions more uniform strategically and institutionally.

Putin's aggressive actions clearly show that Germany and its European partners have taken too little responsibility for their own security for too long and too little. At the same time, China's actions pose additional challenges to Germany and the EU economically, technologically, socially and geopolitically. It is the effects of the increasing systemic rivalry between liberal democracies and authoritarian regimes that are now also affecting Germany, the EU and other allies as a whole. Hamas' insidious attack on Israel has escalated the unresolved Middle East conflict. Even after the re-election of Donald Trump as US president, the USA remains our closest ally and partner. Nevertheless, it is now more important than ever that Germany itself and within the EU and NATO demonstrates its ability to act. To do this, we need an EU that can actively defend its foundation of freedom, the rule of law, human rights, democracy and the social market economy. The overall geopolitical situation illustrates the considerable pressure for reform on German foreign, security and development policy. When so much changes, we have to change too. We Free Democrats are convinced that realpolitik and the commitment to freedom and human rights do not have to be mutually exclusive worldwide."

In view of the changed security situation, the SPD is planning to introduce a new, flexible military service.

For us, it is true that Germany and NATO will not become a party to the war themselves. That is why we stand by Chancellor Olaf Scholz's decision not to supply the Taurus cruise missile from the Bundeswehr's stocks. Civilian support for Ukraine is indispensable. After all, the question of whether Ukraine can hold its own in the Russian war of aggression also depends on how resilient its civilian population is. A strong society needs a functioning power supply and functioning hospitals. Putin also knows this when he deliberately has civilian infrastructure shelled. So we want to continue to be supportive here and help the people in Ukraine get through this hard time. We expressly welcome peace initiatives such as those initiated by Ukrainian President Zelensky."

This requires reliable financing with a defence budget that permanently meets the goals and needs agreed in NATO and also nationally defined, and that permanently invests well over 2 per cent of gross domestic product in our security and defence capability. This will not be financed solely from current revenues, but will also have to be financed in the medium term through higher borrowing in order to prevent investments in the defence sector from being at the expense of other necessary investments in the future.
