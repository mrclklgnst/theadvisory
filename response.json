          "content": "AFD: Medium-sized companies in particular, which are responsible for the majority of jobs, especially in the metalworking industry, are dependent on the continued existence of the combustion engine. It is therefore the task of the Federal Government to ensure that legislation is open to technology at national and European level. The current one-sided preference for electromobility must be stopped immediately, as well as the financing of the charging infrastructure from public funds. This cannot be used nationwide due to a lack of electricity capacities and infrastructure. Battery production also has a far greater impact on the environment than the combustion engine. Whether the internal combustion engine will one day be replaced by other drive forms or continue to exist must once again become a question of technical progress and the market, and must not be based on ideological prohibition policies. If the existing, unrealistic EU CO\u2082 reduction legislation in the transport sector cannot be prevented, synthetic fuels must be considered as a sustainable fuel for combustion engines. Vehicles with combustion engines that are powered by synthetic fuel must be treated equally with electrically powered vehicles in terms of their tax burden. This applies both to the energy source itself and to the vehicle as a whole."
