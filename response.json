In addition, the processing times for BAf\u00f6G applications must be shortened \u2013 through further digitization and simplification. We want to continue and increase the successful federal Young Housing programme in order to create affordable housing for trainees and students. In addition, we will provide greater support for dual studies and extend the protective rights of the Vocational Education and Training Act to this training path as well. We want good working conditions at schools and daycare centers. Daycare centers and schools must be attractive places of learning and working with good working conditions. In order to meet the best possible standards for contemporary daycare and school buildings in the many upcoming new buildings and renovations, we therefore want to create more incentives for providers. We want to make the education system fit for the immigration society. Our immigration society needs an education system that opens up all opportunities for children from different backgrounds to attend daycare centers and schools successfully. We also want to reflect diversity in curricula, textbooks and in the pedagogical professions. Students from different backgrounds should be able to identify with them."

We want to significantly reduce fixed-term contracts with objective reasons. We reject fixed-term contracts without objective reasons and chain fixed-term contracts. These measures are also intended to help close the income gap between men and women. Collective agreements are an important instrument for achieving good wages and working conditions. However, collective bargaining has been in free fall for 25 years, with only 49 per cent of employment contracts still covered by collective bargaining.
