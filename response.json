We will promote the procurement of climate-friendly trucks and local buses, where CO emissions can be saved particularly quickly. We are tackling the shortage of drivers 2 drivers in road freight transport and enforce humane, fair and attractive working conditions for professional drivers inside and outside their vehicles, for example the inclusion of the truck cab in the protection of the Workplace Ordinance.

We want to enable a contactless and uniform payment system at all charging stations and one's own car as an electricity storage system at home. Refuelling at the public charging station must not be punished with high price surcharges. The driver's license has simply become too expensive for many young people. This leads to problems, especially in rural areas.

We will continue on this path consistently. We will also push ahead with the reduction of bureaucracy at national and EU level, for example by merging, simplifying and digitising documentation and reporting obligations. New laws must be subjected to a practical review. In reducing bureaucracy, we are taking advantage of the opportunities offered by digitalisation.

By prioritising local public transport, rail, walking and cycling, Germany is becoming a pioneering country for modern mobility.

Less congestion and air pollution, more accessibility and road safety are our goals. We want a functioning coexistence in traffic to succeed and for everyone to reach their destination safely. This can only be achieved if excessive speeds are reduced. In the government, with the reform of road traffic law for municipalities, we have taken a first step to create an easier 30 km/h speed limit, to strengthen walking and cycling and to create traffic-calmed and liveable neighbourhoods. In a next step, we want to give our municipalities even more leeway, for example to enable a 30 km/h speed limit throughout the city. Germany is the only country in the world to allow unlimited speeding on motorways \u2013 to the detriment of human lives and the environment. A safety speed of 130 km/h on motorways as a general speed limit is therefore overdue.

          "content": "CDU: The planning approval procedure remains the most suitable instrument for the construction of new large-scale infrastructure. However, it must become more efficient through a mandatory procedural master plan, a cut-off date regulation, an obligation to cooperate and digitalisation. Private transport and public transport belong together and must be designed to be barrier-free. Bus, train, boat, plane and car, bicycle and pedestrian traffic complement each other in a meaningful way. In addition to electromobility, all climate-friendly options for alternative drive systems and energy-efficient fuels are to be used. These include, for example, e-fuels, hydrogen and sustainable biofuels. We stand for openness to technology. Our goal is to become the technology leader in autonomous driving and sustainable drives for all modes of transport. Innovative mobility \u2013 especially in aviation \u2013 is of great importance to us. To this end, we are relying on new cycle paths, the expansion of the network and mobile stations, especially at transport hubs. We are strengthening \"shared mobility\" as a future market. The future of freight transport belongs to emission-free freight transport, rail and waterways. We will also look at new technologies."

A functioning state \u2013 our promise for the future The traffic light has argued and destroyed trust. We want to act and regain trust \u2013 faster, more efficiently, digitally and with leaner structures. We act. What matters most now: \u2022  We are halving the number of commissioners and getting by with at least ten percent fewer staff in the ministerial administration and the Bundestag administration. Today's debts are tomorrow's tax increases. We clearly reject all forms of liability for the debts of other EU states."
