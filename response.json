Despite the current high tax revenues, the constantly increasing consumption expenditure leaves less and less room for necessary investments. As a result, this leads to demands for tax increases and additional debt. We are committed to moving away from excessive taxation and in return for spending discipline in order to strengthen private households and our companies as well as to comply with the debt brake and reduce debt. We plan to simplify the complex German tax law. CONSOLIDATE THE FEDERAL BUDGET, END TAX WASTE, COMPLY WITH THE DEBT BRAKE Germany does not have a revenue problem, but an expenditure problem. Despite still high tax revenues, the federal government regularly fails to bring in a federal budget without further new debt. We must not continue to burden future generations with debts and interest. That is why we call for tax waste to be avoided. The main examples are the reduction of senseless expenditures owed to the alleged \"climate rescue\", as well as the termination of the financing of superfluous prestige projects, especially abroad."

No German liability for foreign banks With the European Banking Union, the German savings banks, cooperative banks and the German private banking industry, which have so far been anchored in the local government, would be subject to EU redistribution. The planned European deposit insurance scheme would be the largest joint liability facility in the EU at several trillion euros. Through this mutualization, German savers would be liable with their deposits for ailing banks in other countries that have high and risky loan claims on their balance sheets. Huge defaults would only be a matter of time and would directly trigger a German payment obligation. This would be a further step towards the liability and transfer union rejected by the AfD. The AfD demands that German banks limit liabilities to the national level and continue to be able to maintain their own institutional, liability and deposit guarantee solutions specific to the banking group, such as the exclusively regionally active and locally anchored savings banks and cooperative banks. We advocate the restoration of national sovereignty across all financial services. We oppose the European communitarisation of liability risks."

Sustainable social security systems Demographic change is putting social security systems under pressure. However, ever-increasing premiums cannot be a solution.

At the municipal level, a large part of the investments necessary for structural change is incurred anyway. At the same time, the financial situation of many municipalities is serious. We must and want to change that. A solution to the specific problem of old municipal debts is finally needed. In doing so, we want to ensure that the situation of the East German municipalities is also taken into account, which are also challenged by legacy issues through no fault of their own, such as the situation of the old municipal housing companies or the Entitlement and Expectancy Transfer Act (AA\u00dcG). In addition, we are committed to long-term support and financing agreements between the state levels, especially in the areas of education, transport and supply infrastructure, urban development, heat planning and energy efficiency. In addition, larger and modern capacities for infrastructure planning of the municipalities are required, for example for cross-municipal investment planning or joint personnel deployment. We want to significantly simplify and reduce bureaucracy in funding programmes as far as possible. We want to achieve a systematic improvement in municipal finances."
