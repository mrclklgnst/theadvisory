The allowances are to be indexed in order to rule out secret tax increases in the future. These measures take into account the wage gap requirement and motivate people to participate in working life. We also consider the corresponding shift from further tariff benchmarks up to the top tax rate to be necessary. Abolish property tax and compensate for tax losses The collection of property tax, which benefits cities and municipalities, is extremely complicated and involves a very high administrative burden. The federal model is calculated according to the standard land values, which are often outdated, inaccurate or arbitrary. The property tax also violates the principle of equality, as it does not take into account the individual characteristics of the properties. Therefore, it will be abolished completely. The municipalities are fully compensated by a surcharge on income tax and corporation tax. This is based on the economic performance of the taxpayers. This also relieves tenants. Introduce family splitting According to Article 6 of the Basic Law, marriage and family are under the special protection of the state order."

More housing benefit instead of social housing The previous social housing construction has failed, it can only reach a fraction of the eligible. It leads to incorrect receipts and causes high costs for the taxpayer. It is better to provide more housing benefit to low-income tenants, which ensures social mix. If the housing benefit is not sufficient to secure an apartment, citizens must also be paid a municipal housing benefit."

In view of high interest rates and construction costs as well as increasing financial burdens on broad sections of the population and municipalities, it is high time for a trend reversal in new residential construction. Non-profit housing construction must be strengthened. Larger parts of the housing market must again be subject to the rules of non-profit status, non-profit and municipal housing companies should receive low-interest loans and launch a large housing construction program. Where social housing is built, the social commitment must apply permanently. Tenants have to spend more and more on housing, especially in metropolitan areas and university towns. Instead of increasing housing benefit, which ultimately only benefits property owners, the state should cap rents and invest in the construction of new rental apartments \u2013 with a clear focus on the low-cost segment."

We will campaign for the adoption of a law to better combat rent usury and take legal action against grossly excessive rents for furnished rooms. It is also necessary to accelerate construction projects, for example by simplifying serial construction and introducing a simplified approval procedure for social housing. At federal, state and local level, we advocate initiatives to tighten regulation of the conversion of apartments into commercial holiday homes and to combat housing vacancies. Costs for renovations have to be borne by the landlords. We want to curb speculation on building land and promote an active, long-term land policy and a sustainable urban development policy with mixed neighbourhoods.
