Recognition of asylum currently leads to immediate equality in all social security systems, without any previous personal contribution. This is unfair in terms of social and tax policy. The AfD therefore calls for the reduction of incentives and the preservation of social justice: Social benefits for asylum seekers should be provided as benefits in kind if possible, otherwise by means of a payment card, if the provision of benefits in kind is not possible with reasonable effort. Benefits for those obliged to leave the country are to be reduced to a subsistence level that is in line with human dignity. In addition, recognition must no longer mean an automatic, immediate, unlimited entitlement to all welfare state benefits in terms of time and content. Benefit cuts for asylum seekers in the event of rejection of job opportunities."

Repatriation measures are circumvented with the help of old and new regulations on the right to stay, so illegal residence is thus made permanent. This is also served by the frequently used instrument of toleration of persons obliged to leave the country, a practice with which these people receive a residence permit that is constantly extended, sometimes in the form of a chain of toleration. In principle, a temporary suspension of deportation is only a certificate of temporary suspension of deportation. Under no circumstances, however, should the granting of a temporary suspension of deportation justify permanent residence. With the newly introduced so-called opportunity right of residence, tolerated persons who had lived in Germany for 5 years as of January 1, 2022 were even given the chance to obtain a residence permit within 18 months if the lowest requirements were met. In conclusion, it can be stated that the basic intention of the right of residence, the control and limitation of the influx of foreigners, has been reversed and downright perverted for years."

The reference to an allegedly necessary verification of responsibility for the asylum procedure expressly does not apply here, as this would also be possible in the already safe neighbouring EU state that has previously been crossed. Measures to maintain public security and protect internal security also take precedence over European rules on asylum and aliens law. In addition, the waiver of internal border controls was only agreed to at the time on the condition that external border security is guaranteed and that all EU member states comply with the standards for the implementation of asylum procedures and the Dublin regulations. In addition, mass migration to the EU was not foreseeable since 2015 when the EU Treaty was ratified in 1993. Thus, the basis of the European asylum regulation has ceased to exist, which is why there is no longer any obligation for Germany in this respect."

That is why we want to critically review the amount of social benefits, for example in the Asylum Seekers' Benefits Act, and standardise it at European level in the future. We are also relying on more benefits in kind instead of cash and demand that the payment card, which has long been decided, be used everywhere and without unnecessary exceptions. Anyone who is legally and enforceably obliged to leave the country and has a reasonable opportunity to leave Germany is usually no longer allowed to receive state support.

          "content": "Linke: For a just immigration society, defend the right to asylum The Left Party stands for an immigrant society based on solidarity, in which all people have the same rights and opportunities, regardless of passport, origin, skin colour, cultural or religious affiliation. We fight against anti-Semitism, antigypsyism, anti-Muslim racism, anti-Black racism and every other form of racism and for an end to structural as well as institutional discrimination Exclusions permeate all areas of life, in particular our education system, the labour and housing market and public administration. Every person must have full access to social, political and cultural rights Our vision is a just and open society in which equal participation is a matter of course The migration debate from the right turns migrants and refugees into scapegoats for the failed policies in the interests of the rich Instead of a debate between an \"us\" and \"them\" that plays people off against each other, Die Linke is guided by the model of a democratic and social immigration society that focuses on human dignity In order to shape this and enable refugees to arrive well, appropriate legal, financial and structural framework conditions must be created so that municipalities in particular are not left alone with the tasks of supply, accommodation and integrative services More investment is needed in public infrastructure and social cohesion, i."

When clarifying identity, we will ensure clear regulations, taking into account the security interests of the state. We want to control migration with humanitarian responsibility. We have provided new clarity in migration policy \u2013 for a paradigm shift towards orderly migration to the labour market and better control of forced migration. At the European level, the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) will apply from 2026. We want humanitarian standards for refugees to exist throughout Europe and migration to be managed in solidarity. The individual human right to asylum and international refugee law are the basis for the Common European Asylum System. Border procedures must ensure high legal standards. Our goal is a truly solidarity-based distribution in which all member states participate. This requires more than a loosely agreed solidarity mechanism in the European Union. Border closures and blanket rejections at internal borders contradict the spirit of a common area of freedom, security and justice. The temporary reintroduction of internal border controls must therefore remain the absolute exception."
