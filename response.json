In addition, the outdated credit ceilings must be reformed: In addition to the introduction of exemptions for important investments in the future, we are committed to a more flexible design of the deficit rule itself. The states are to be given the opportunity to borrow. This is done in accordance with European fiscal rules. In order to enable more security and long-term planning in the event of a crisis, we are striving to reform the emergency regulations so that our state is able to act at any time and across all years. The repayment obligations lead to savings pressures in future national budgets. This artificially prolongs the financial crisis and shifts the burden of a one-off emergency situation to future generations. We are therefore committed to changing this unjust mechanism."

The rent brake is a very good instrument for curbing rising rents. And we want to ensure stable and affordable rents in tight housing markets in the long term. In metropolitan areas, short-term rentals are to be reduced to a minimum. The rent brake is to apply indefinitely and also to properties occupied until 2019 in order to ensure stable and affordable rents in tight housing markets in the long term. We will ensure that the rent brake cannot be circumvented by, for example, (partially) furnished and temporary housing offers."

We are committed to moving away from excessive taxation and in return for spending discipline in order to strengthen private households and our companies as well as to comply with the debt brake and reduce debt. We plan to simplify the complex German tax law. CONSOLIDATE THE FEDERAL BUDGET, END TAX WASTE, COMPLY WITH THE DEBT BRAKE Germany does not have a revenue problem, but an expenditure problem. Despite still high tax revenues, the federal government regularly fails to bring in a federal budget without further new debt. We must not continue to burden future generations with debts and interest. That is why we call for tax waste to be avoided.

No German liability for foreign banks With the European Banking Union, the German savings banks, cooperative banks and the German private banking industry, which have so far been anchored in the local government, would be subject to EU redistribution. The planned European deposit insurance scheme would be the largest joint liability facility in the EU at several trillion euros. Through this mutualization, German savers would be liable with their deposits for ailing banks in other countries that have high and risky loan claims on their balance sheets. Huge defaults would only be a matter of time and would directly trigger a German payment obligation. This would be a further step towards the liability and transfer union rejected by the AfD. The AfD demands that German banks limit liabilities to the national level and continue to be able to maintain their own institutional, liability and deposit guarantee solutions specific to the banking group, such as the exclusively regionally active and locally anchored savings banks and cooperative banks.
